National Supercomputing Center is an association of legal entities established in November 2020 with the aim of becoming the leading organization for the field of high-performance computing (HPC) in Slovakia.

## OUR MISSION
Our goal is to support and coordinate all HPC activities in Slovakia. Since 2020, we have been committed to developing HPC infrastructure, supporting projects and investments, and strengthening competencies and skills in this field. We aim to foster collaboration with Slovak universities, the Slovak Academy of Sciences, and other organizations active in the areas of HPC, HPC+ applications, and related fields.

High-performance computing (HPC) or the use of supercomputers has traditionally been primarily the domain of academic research and development, especially in the natural sciences. Today, thanks to advances in HPC technologies, applications, and to a significant extent due to the rise of artificial intelligence and the need to process large datasets, we are witnessing an increased demand for high-performance computing infrastructure.
